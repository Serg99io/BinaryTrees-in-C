# Assignment5

In this assignment we needed to implement binary trees in C. It was needed to make different functions and procedures to do different things concerning binary (search) trees. If the repository is cloned it is possible to use the "make" command. It will run the main function and put the output in main. The output consists of examples for every part of the assignment. With the command "./main" you will see this output. To clean the output you can use the command "make clean" on the linux command line.  

For step 10 I took code from https://gist.github.com/VictorGarritano/5f894be162d39e9bdd5c and adjusted it a little (like removing double numbers in the tree). If you want to build a red-black tree and see the inorder traversal of it you need to do cc rbtree.c in the command line and ./a.out to check it. I choose not to include it in the makefile because it was not my code and could have unforeseen errors.
